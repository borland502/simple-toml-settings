# Future Plans

- allow custom folder as well as custom file name. Perhaps option to just store
  the config file in the users home directory? The default option of putting it
  in a sub-folder of the project is useful for projects that need to store extra
  data, but may be overkill for basic projects.
- finish docs
- add Development imformation to the docs
